DroidSteal
==========


DroidSteal is a new client that runs on top of a modified version of the original DroidSheep's services.

Things to remember:

1. This is Alpha software, there may be bugs and other problems, fill out an Issue Ticket and wait for a response.

2. This is for people to learn about security, networks, and android - It's not for use on networks you don't have permission to use it on.

3. This is a constantly evolving project - the goals may change and so may the features.

4. For obvious purposes this may never be released to the Play Store, I hope it will be, but no guarantees.

5. This is open-source software, get involved and have fun! Contribute contribute contribute!

6. Be Ethical
